What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository it adds a .git repository to your current files. 	You need to do this in order to use commands specifically for git (i.e. git 		commit, git status, etc)
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area helps files get from the working directory to the repository.
	The staging area provides an organized area to see which files you've added; these 	are the files that you can then commit to your repository
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	You use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
	change by only staging one file at a time. This way, your commits only focus on 	changes in one area instead of multiple areas.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	Branches are helpful when you want to move forward on an idea or experimental 		feature, while still maintaining a version of your work that works. This allows 	you to try out new concepts without fear of messing up your project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Diagrams help you see where other branches where formed in terms of the master 		branch's commit history. This helps you also see the parent commit for each commit 	and the tips of each branch
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	merging two branches together allows you to combine their commit histories and 	changes together. We rep it the way we do to show that the commit came from both branches.
 

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
	Git's automatic merging is helpful in terms of efficiently and streamlining the process, but it can lead to merged branches that you didn't want to merge. Merging manually, though, can be annoying and lead to errors in when to/ not to merge, but it will allow you to merge more meaningfully
